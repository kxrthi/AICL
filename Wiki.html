        <p class="content bg">Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level,located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China Nepalborder runs across its summit point.Its elevation of 8,848.86 m was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.</p>
        <p class="content bg">Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. It still remains to be one of the oldest mountains aging over 60 millions years old.</p>
